# 2_trippy_app
Trippy a python open-cv based photo filter app. 

See folders Win and Mac for windows and OSX based versions of this app. 

Function:
 This is a simple application that uses tkinter and opencv to load some videofeed from the camera, take pictures and apply filters to the live feed. Filters are based on known statistical noise/data filters that resulted in some trippy results. 
 
 How to use:
 -If you run python on your machine, you can just copy the file trippy.py and run it locally. 
 -If you don't have python, or don't want to go through the trouble installing OpenCV, Pillow and Tkinter, you can just   navigate to the respective operating system folder and find the .exe or .app files and run it. 
 
 
 Hope you enjoy!
